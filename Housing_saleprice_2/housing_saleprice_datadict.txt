Problem Statement A key challenge for property sellers is to determine the sale price of the property. Some are apparent and obvious, and some are not. Nevertheless, a rational approach aided by machine learning can be very useful in predicting the property price. A large data set with 79 different features (like living area, number of rooms, location, etc) along with their prices are provided for residential homes. The challenge is to learn a relationship between the important features and the price. Further, use it to predict the prices of a new set of houses.
